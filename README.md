## You have graph and you want to find the shortest distance from a point to another point and also your graph have weight .

#### At first you should type the how many of manes. Than you should type your graph like that:

### At the end:
#### you see one thing like that :
  - ```python
    in input ==>
    3
    1 2 10
    2 3 1
    3 1 3
    in output ==>
    1 2 4, 1 3 3 #It means the distance between 1 and 2 is 4 / It means the distance between 1 and 3 is 3
    2 1 4, 2 3 1 #It means the distance between 2 and 1 is 4 / It means the distance between 2 and 3 is 1
    3 1 3, 3 2 1 #It means the distance between 3 and 1 is 3 / It means the distance between 3 and 2 is 1
    ```
